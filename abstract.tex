\chapter*{Abstract} \label{cha:abstract}


The fourth generation of nuclear reactors represent a series of six novel reactor designs.
These consist of supercritical water reactors, very high temperature reactors, sodium-cooled fast
reactors, lead-cooled fast reactors, gas-cooled fast reactors and molten salt reactors.
The critical aspects of safety and efficiency
of new and historical designs are analysed.
The most important concepts required to understand these technologies are
also introduced. 
Through literature review it is found that generation IV nuclear reactors are more safe
and efficient than historical and current designs. Additionally they are found to be 
significantly more sustainable than older reactors. However, more
investigation is needed to assess their complete environmental impact and usefulness
in combating climate change.
