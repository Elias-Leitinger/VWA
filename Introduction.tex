\chapter{Introduction}
Nuclear power reactors represent a flexible method of energy generation. However, the designs
currently in use have fallen behind what can be expected of modern power plants in terms
of efficiency and safety. There are fundamentally new reactor designs, which represent
a great leap in technological advancement and are grouped into the Generation IV of nuclear reactors.
These designs have been developed with efficiency, safety and sustainability in mind.
To understand these developments and designs, we will first give a short introduction into the
basic concepts and technologies involved in nuclear fission reactors. Then, we will examine the
technological developments of nuclear reactors over past generations and give an overview on
the reactor designs, which are currently in use.
Furthermore, we are going to analyse the fourth generation
of nuclear reactors based on the aspects of safety and efficiency.
Lastly, we will take a short digression into the relation of climate change and nuclear power.
