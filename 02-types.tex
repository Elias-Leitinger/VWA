\subsection{PWR â€“ Pressurized Water Reactor}
Pressurized water reactors harness $\ce{H_{2}O}$ as coolant and moderator. However they have at least
two coolant circuits. The water in the primary coolant circuit is under a large pressure in order
to still remain liquid even at the high temperatures generated inside the reactor core. Between the primary
and secondary coolant circuit lay a steam generator, which turns the cool water supplied in the secondary circuit
into steam used to drive turbines. Special attention needs to be drawn to the fact, that primary and secondary
circuit are never directly connected and therefore no radioactive material can be passed from inside the reactor core
though the steam generator. Therefore only the reactor components which lay before the steam generator
need to be under containment.~\footcite{WNPR} %%TODO: IMAGE of PWR
