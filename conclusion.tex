\chapter{Conclusion}
It is safe to conclude that generation IV nuclear reactors represent a considerable improvement
over older, obsolete systems. Especially molten salt reactors present a viable and attractive
solution for global energy provision because of their flexibility and effectiveness.
Therefore they represent a viable alternative to the older less
efficient and safe power reactors. Because of the mitigation of the fuel issue through fast reactors,
at least a fuel shortage will not be a problem in foreseeable future. Therefore they may play an
important role in the aversion of climate change. Furthermore, because the decision horizon for
measures necessary to avert global warming get closer by the day, it may at some point be a
necessary bridge gap solution.
